But the Arabian sultanate has been seriously ramping up its efforts to bring in tourists to the country, with the promise of easy visas and that epic zipline \u2013 which is planned for the picturesque mountain village Misfat Al Abriyeen. That has been the plan for a couple of years now, so expect plenty of queues when it eventually opens. But despite its world\u2019s longest zipline bid, Oman is everything nearby Dubai isn\u2019t: generally favouring low-rise Middle Eastern charm and Bedouin traditions over being the biggest or showiest. So expect natural beauty and friendly locals. The almost constant sunshine doesn\u2019t hurt, either.",

            "Summary": "Nothing beats the warm, fuzzy feeling of stepping out of the winter cold and into a warm, cosy pub. And Dublin does an unbeatable line in warm, inviting boozers\u2014from low-lit\u00a0watering holes that have barely changed since Victorian times to drinking spots known for their live music and rabble-rousing atmosphere. Head to the 250-year-old Long Hall for obscure ales with extra character, The Cobblestone in Smithfield\u2019s for quaintness in spades and live music, or settle in for a session at Toners. It has a short but sweet whisky list and strong literary ties\u2014it\u2019s rumoured to have been the only place WB Yeats would go for a drink.",

To beat the crowds, head over in November before summer truly kicks in. The Change Overnight Hotel, a boutique apartment-style hotel where guests are invited to choose one of eight causes that their stay will contribute to, has been a revelation. Base yourself here to explore the historic city of Launceston, meet the peacocks in the picturesque Cataract Gorge, and visit the Southern Wild Distillery in Devonport for gin made using locally foraged botanicals.

            "Summary": "With visitor numbers steadily picking up, you might want to get in there and see the Pyramids quick. As yet the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo remains unopened (sometime in 2023 is the plan), meaning antiquities such as Tutankhamun\u2019s gold mask and a behemoth, 83-tonne, fist-clenching statue of Ramses II are almost within reach. Still, history is tangible here, and it oozes out every nook and cranny. The Sphinx International Airport on the Giza side of the city should make it easier to drop in for an immersive ancient history lesson from the country\u2019s beaches too.",

The most iconic is held in front of the illuminated, baroque Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, with crafts, gingerbread and an enormous tree, while Art Advent on Karlsplatz has live music and an all-organic policy on the food. And while Vienna may be very good,Salzburg\u2019s a bit subversive, too: at its folkloric Krampus parades in early December, goat-demon characters run riot through the streets. Less scarily, it\u2019s also home to the uniquely Christmassy Salzburg Advent Singing, featuring traditionally dressed Alpine folk choirs and festive markets\u2014the Christkindlmarkt is one of the world\u2019s oldest.",

All kinds of cold-weather dwelling creatures live here, from arctic foxes to lynxes, wolverines and snow hares\u2014but go in December to see Rudolph and his chums in the snowy winter paradise that is Finnish Lapland.
